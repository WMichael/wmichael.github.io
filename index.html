        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          Michael is a very organised and motivated individual who has a deep interest in software development and testing. Through his studies at university, he has been able to develop excellent team working and time management skills, enabling a successful portfolio of work. Michael is highly interested in self-development, working on personal projects and learning new skills, such as JavaScript in his spare time. This has allowed him to continue to expand both his set of soft and technical based skills. During university, Michael gained a lot of experience using Java in areas such as databases and web applications, user interfaces and cryptography. Michael takes a reasoned approach when communicating ideas, to produce solutions to challenging problems.
